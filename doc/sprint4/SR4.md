# Unfinished tasks
None!  

# Practices that we should continue during next sprint
- No more sprints, but testing 3 days before demo helped us catch bugs.

# New practices that we might want to use during next sprint
- No more sprints, but a good practice to start would be multiple PR reviews. One review wasnt always enough.

# Harmful practices we should stop using during next sprint
- No more sprints, but not talking during standup takes away purpose of standup. Should talk to each other more   

# Best experience during Sprint 3
- Trivia page working and looking good and no bugs. Search page and following working well too!

# Worst experience during Sprint 3
- Almost nothing. We fixed all the small bugs we had, we completed all our tasks, we didn't rush to test. The only "bad" part was figuring out how to divide tasks equally (since there were some big and some small ones).
